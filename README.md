# DiceGame
A 2 player based game that rolls a dice and the active player has to click hold to add it to their current score. Initially, the 1st player is active and whenever 1 is encountered on the dice, the 2nd player becomes active and then the flow continues. In this verse, if the score of any player becomes 50 or greater, the player wins.
